excerpt: "Crimpy start to a high-step gaston; crux is keeping hips in during the barn-door move."

## Beta
1. Right hand crimp start, left hand undercling. High right foot on smear.
2. Engage **core** to prevent barn door; bump RH to slopey crimp, match.
3. Left foot to volume; **flag left** to keep center of mass under hold.
4. Deadpoint to jug; control swing with toe-catch. Top out with three points.

## Training notes
- Weakness: lock-off strength on right arm. Add 7/3 repeaters on 20mm edge.
- Drills: silent feet, hip-in on volumes, 4×4 circuit at V3–V4.
