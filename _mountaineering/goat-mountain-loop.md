## Route notes
BCMC → Goat Mtn Loop; snow from 1200 m in gullies. Practiced map+compass legs and whiteout bearings.

## Splits
- TH → Junction: 42 min
- Junction → Summit: 55 min
- Summit → TH: 1h 05m

## What I'd change next time
Earlier start for firmer snow; microspikes were enough, axe stayed on pack.
